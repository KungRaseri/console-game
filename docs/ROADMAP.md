# Development Roadmap

**Purpose**: High-level development vision and work organization for RealmEngine console game.

**Scope**: Console game backend, APIs, and game logic. UI implementation (Godot) is out of scope but we design service APIs for future integration.

**Status Source**: See [IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md](IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md) for detailed feature status and test coverage.

## 🎯 Quick Wins (Integration-Only Work)
**Goal**: Connect existing production-ready code that's been orphaned

### LocationGenerator Integration
- **Status**: `[✅ Finished]`
- **Effort**: Low (integration-only)
- **Impact**: HIGH - Unlocks location-specific content
- **Work**: ~~Wire 300+ lines of LocationGenerator into ExplorationService~~ **DONE**
- **File**: `RealmEngine.Core.Generators.Modern.LocationGenerator`
- **Dependencies**: None
- **API Impact**: `GetKnownLocationsAsync()` returns `List<Location>` with dynamic generation (2 towns, 3 dungeons, 3 wilderness)
- **Details**: 
  - Made `GenerateLocationsAsync()` virtual for testing
  - Changed from `List<string>` to `List<Location>` with Id/Name/Description/Type
  - Added `InitializeLocationsAsync()` for lazy loading
  - All 7,823 tests passing

---

### Quest Service Connections
- **Status**: `[Not Started]`
- **Effort**: Low
- **Impact**: HIGH - Makes quests playable
- **Work**: 
  - Hook QuestService/QuestProgressService into gameplay loop
  - Connect kill counters to UpdateProgressAsync()
  - Trigger completion events
- **Files**: `QuestService`, `QuestProgressService`, `MainQuestService`
- **Dependencies**: Quest Service API (see Core Loop)
- **API Impact**: Quest progress updates automatically during gameplay

## 🎨 UI Technology Evolution
**Status**: `[Out of Scope for Console]`

**Note**: Console game is backend only. Godot UI integration is a separate project that will consume our service APIs.

**When ready for Godot**:
- All game logic remains in C# console backend
- Godot frontend calls our exposed APIs
- Backend runs as service/process
- Communication via IPC or local networking

**This is not on the roadmap** - we design APIs to be UI-agnostic
