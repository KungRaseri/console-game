## Recent Progress (January 7, 2026)

### ✅ Options 1 & 2 Complete

#### Option 1: Core.Tests Combat Test - FIXED ✅
- **ExecuteEnemyAttack_Should_Apply_Defense_Reduction_When_Defending**: Now passing
- **Core.Tests**: 846/846 (100%) ✅
- All combat tests working correctly

#### Option 2: Passive Abilities - ALL PRESENT ✅
- All 16 previously "missing" abilities found in catalog:
  - bladework, combat-supremacy, crusader, deaths-door
  - elemental-mastery, king-of-beasts, legendary-swagger
  - master-of-blades, master-thief, master-tracker
  - primal-bond, sentinel, shadow-master
  - titans-strengtCore.Tests**: 846/846 (100%)
- ✅ **RealmEngine.Shared.Tests**: 665/665 (100%)
- ✅ **RealmEngine.Data.Tests**: 5,250/5,250 (100%)
- ⚠️ **RealmForge.Tests**: 169/174 (97.1%) - 5 reference resolution failures (deferred)

### 🎯 Remaining Next Steps
1. **Add missing names files** (5 files) - Completes name generation system
2. **Fix 2 skills references** - Required for item requirements
3. **Add selectionWeight to skills** - Compliance fix
### ✅ Socketable Generators Fixed
- **Path resolution**: Updated all 5 socketable generators (Gem, Crystal, Essence, Orb, Rune) to support both source data (`items/{type}/`) and package data (`{type}/`) paths
- **All tests passing**: 29/29 socketable generator tests now working
- **Dual-path support**: Generators use fallback pattern `items/{type}/ ?? {type}/` for compatibility

### 📊 Current Test Status
- ✅ **RealmEngine.Shared.Tests**: 665/665 (100%)
- ⚠️ **RealmEngine.Core.Tests**: 845/846 (99.9%) - 1 combat test failure
- ✅ **RealmEngine.Data.Tests**: 5,250/5,250 (100%)
- ⚠️ **RealmForge.Tests**: 169/174 (97.1%) - 5 reference resolution failures (deferred)

### 🎯 Next Priorities
1. **Fix Core.Tests combat test** (1 test) - Quick win to reach 100%
2. **Add 27 missing passive abilities** - Unlocks class progression
3. **Add missing names files** (5 files) - Completes name generation system
4. **Fix 2 skills references** - Required for item requirements
