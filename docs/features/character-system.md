# Character System

**Status**: See [IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md](../IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md)

## Overview

The Character System provides the foundation for player identity and progression through attributes, classes, and character creation.

## Core Components

### Attribute System
Six core attributes (STR, DEX, CON, INT, WIS, CHA) affecting all aspects of gameplay with derived stats (HP, MP, damage, dodge, etc.).

### Class System
Multiple unique character classes with distinct playstyles, starting bonuses, equipment, and signature abilities. Players can choose from premade classes or create custom/procedural classes tailored to their preferred playstyle.

### Character Creation
Guided process for name selection, class selection, attribute distribution, equipment setup, and resource initialization.

## Key Features

- **Attribute Distribution**: Points allocated based on class choice or custom distribution
- **Derived Statistics**: HP, MP, damage, defense, dodge, and crit chance calculated from attributes
- **Class Flexibility**: Premade classes for quick start, custom classes for personalization, or procedural generation for variety
- **Class Differentiation**: Each class archetype offers unique starting advantages and recommended builds
- **Character Identity**: Name validation and class-based starting equipment
