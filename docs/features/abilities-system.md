# Abilities System

**Status**: See [IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md](../IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md)

## Overview

The Abilities System provides **383 total abilities** organized by activation type and power tier. Abilities are special powers that characters acquire through class selection, progression, and discovery. Unlike skills (passive proficiencies), abilities are discrete powers with specific effects. Unlike spells (learnable magic), abilities are inherent character powers not requiring spell acquisition.

## Core Philosophy

**"Special Powers"**: Abilities are signature moves defining character identity. A Warrior's Charge, a Rogue's Backstab, a Mage's Fireball—these are memorable powers that feel impactful.

**Active Activation**: Abilities must be manually triggered during appropriate situations (combat turns, exploration moments).

**Class Identity**: Each class has a unique ability set reflecting their archetype. Warriors are melee-focused, Rogues are cunning, Mages are arcane.

**Distinct from Skills & Spells**: 
- **Skills** = Passive proficiencies practiced through use (54 skills, ranks 0-100)
- **Abilities** = Special powers with activation requirements (383 abilities, tiers 1-5)
- **Spells** = Learnable magic requiring tradition access (144 spells, ranks 0-10)

### By Power Tier (5 Tiers)

Abilities are tiered by power level (based on `selectionWeight` in data):

- **Tier 1 (Basic)**: selectionWeight < 50 — Starting abilities, common powers
- **Tier 2 (Common)**: selectionWeight 50-99 — Standard abilities
- **Tier 3 (Uncommon)**: selectionWeight 100-199 — Enhanced abilities
- **Tier 4 (Rare)**: selectionWeight 200-399 — Powerful abilities
- **Tier 5 (Epic/Legendary)**: selectionWeight 400+ or Ultimate type — Iconic abilities

**Note**: Ultimate abilities are always tier 5 regardless of selectionWeight.
