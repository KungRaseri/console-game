# Status Effects System

**Status**: See [IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md](../IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md)

## Overview

Status effects add tactical depth through temporary conditions affecting combat and exploration.

## Core Components

### Effect Categories
- **Damage-Over-Time**: Periodic damage (poison, burning, bleeding)
- **Crowd Control**: Movement/action restriction (frozen, stunned, slowed)
- **Stat Modification**: Temporary stat changes (blessed, cursed, weakened)
- **Environmental**: Location-based effects (burning terrain, poison gas)

### Status Mechanics
- **Duration-Based**: Effects last for specific durations with tick rates
- **Resistances & Immunities**: Reduce or prevent effects entirely
- **Cure Methods**: Items, spells, time-based expiration
- **Stacking Rules**: Multiple effects interaction and intensity
- **Visual Indicators**: UI feedback for active statuses

## Key Features

- **Tactical Complexity**: Status effects create combat depth
- **Risk vs Reward**: Powerful effects balanced by countermeasures
- **Build Synergy**: Effects synergize with abilities and traits
- **Visual Clarity**: Players understand active conditions
- **Strategic Planning**: Anticipate and counter enemy effects
