# Skills System

**Status**: See [IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md](../IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md)

## Overview

The Skills System provides practice-based progression where using skills improves proficiency over time. With **54 total skills** organized into 5 categories (Attribute, Weapon, Armor, Magic, Profession), the system offers deep specialization and diverse character builds. Skills are passive bonuses that rank up through repeated use, creating organic character development distinct from level-based progression and separate from the Abilities and Spells systems.

## Core Philosophy

**"Learning by Doing"**: Skills improve naturally through gameplay actions. Use weapons to improve weapon skills, cast spells to improve magic skills, pick locks to improve Lockpicking.

**Passive Bonuses**: Skills provide always-active benefits requiring no manual activation. Effects automatically apply during relevant actions (increased damage, better success rates, reduced costs).

**Attribute Synergy**: Each skill is governed by a related attribute. Skill checks combine skill rank + attribute modifier. A character with high DEX and high Acrobatics gets bonuses from both.

**Distinct from Abilities**: Skills are proficiencies (how good you are at something), abilities are powers (special moves requiring activation). High Light Blades skill makes sword attacks stronger; Whirlwind Attack is a special ability requiring mana/cooldown.

**Distinct from Spells**: Skills are practiced through use; spells are learned through acquisition. Magic skills boost spell effectiveness but don't grant spells. Core tradition skills (Arcane, Divine, Occult, Primal) unlock spell access; specialist skills (Force Magic, Restoration, etc.) boost specific spell types.

## Skill Mechanics

### Ranking System
- **Initial Rank**: Skills start at Rank 0 (untrained)
- **Max Rank**: Cap at Rank 100 (master level)
- **Rank-Up Cost**: XP required increases each rank (simple scaling initially)
  - Early ranks: Fast progression (1-20 ranks quickly)
  - Mid ranks: Moderate progression (20-60 steady growth)
  - High ranks: Slow progression (60-100 significant investment)

### Experience Gain
- **Use-Based**: Skills gain XP from relevant actions defined in skill traits
  - **Combat skills**: Successful attacks, blocks, damage dealt, kills
  - **Magic skills**: Spell casting, successful spell effects, spell damage/healing
  - **Attribute skills**: Specific actions (Athletics from sprinting/jumping, Stealth from sneaking, etc.)
  - **Profession skills**: Crafting items, gathering materials, successful skill checks
- **XP Actions**: Each skill defines specific actions granting XP (stored in `xpActions` trait)
  - Example: Athletics gains 2 XP per sprint, 5 XP per long jump, 15 XP per physical challenge
  - Example: Blacksmithing gains 10 XP per weapon forged, 15 XP per armor piece, 25 XP per masterwork
- **Scaling**: Higher-level challenges grant more skill XP
- **Natural Progression**: No grinding required, skills improve through normal gameplay

### Rank Effects
- **Per-Rank Modifiers**: Each skill has specific bonuses per rank (defined in `effects` trait)
  - **Light Blades Rank 1-100**: +0.5% damage, +0.2% critical chance per rank
  - **Arcane Rank 1-100**: +0.4% spell damage, +0.3% spell critical chance per rank
  - **Restoration Rank 1-100**: +0.6% healing effectiveness per rank
  - **Shield Rank 1-100**: +0.3% block chance, +0.2% damage reduction per rank
  - **Alchemy Rank 1-100**: +1% potion effectiveness per rank
  - **Athletics Rank 1-100**: +0.2% movement speed, +1% jump height per rank
- **Cumulative Bonuses**: Effects stack with attributes, abilities, equipment, and spells
- **Governing Attribute Synergy**: Skill checks use d20 + skill rank + attribute modifier
- **Multiple Effect Types**: Skills can grant various bonuses (damage, defense, movement, costs, etc.)

### Cost Scaling
- **Simple Formula** (initial implementation): `cost = base_cost * (1 + rank * cost_multiplier)`
  - Example: Rank 1→2 costs 100 XP, Rank 50→51 costs 600 XP, Rank 99→100 costs 1,000 XP
- **Prevents Instant Mastery**: High ranks require significant time investment
- **Rewards Specialization**: Easier to master a few skills than max everything

## Skill Integration

### Combat Integration
