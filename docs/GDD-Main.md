## Core Systems

### 1. Character System

#### Attribute System

Characters have six core attributes affecting all aspects of gameplay:

- **Strength**: Affects melee damage output and physical carrying capacity
- **Dexterity**: Affects dodge chance, initiative, and ranged attack precision
- **Constitution**: Affects maximum health and damage resistance
- **Intelligence**: Affects magic damage and mana pool size
- **Wisdom**: Affects mana regeneration and magical defense
- **Charisma**: Affects NPC interactions and shop pricing

**Derived Stats:**
Attributes feed into derived statistics:
- **Health Points (HP)**: Determined by Constitution
- **Mana Points (MP)**: Determined by Intelligence
- **Damage Output**: Determined by Strength (melee/thrown) or Dexterity (ranged)
- **Defensive Rating**: Determined by Dexterity and equipped armor
- **Dodge Chance**: Determined by Dexterity
- **Critical Hit Chance**: Base chance modified by specific attributes and skills

#### Class System

Multiple unique character classes provide distinct playstyles and role-playing opportunities. Each class offers different starting advantages, recommended builds, and tactical approaches to combat and exploration.

**Class Features:**
- Starting attribute bonuses matching class archetype
- Class-appropriate starting equipment
- Signature abilities suited to class role
- Recommended progression paths for new players

#### Character Creation

The character creation process guides players through:

1. **Name Selection**: Choose character identity with input validation
2. **Class Selection**: Review class descriptions and select preferred archetype
3. **Attribute Distribution**: Attributes allocated based on class choice
4. **Equipment Setup**: Receive class-appropriate starting gear
5. **Resource Initialization**: Begin with starting gold and consumables

### 2. Combat System

#### Turn-Based Combat

Combat uses a turn-based system where players and enemies alternate actions. Each turn, players choose from multiple tactical options:

**Player Actions:**
- **Attack**: Strike enemies with equipped weapons, dealing damage based on attributes and gear
- **Defend**: Enter a defensive stance, reducing incoming damage and potentially blocking attacks
- **Use Item**: Consume potions or scrolls for healing, buffs, or tactical advantages
- **Flee**: Attempt to escape combat, with success based on character speed and enemy threat

#### Combat Mechanics

**Damage Calculation:**
Damage output combines weapon power, character attributes, enemy defenses, and situational modifiers. The system rewards matching weapon types to character builds (melee weapons scale with physical attributes, magic weapons scale with mental attributes).

**Defensive Mechanics:**
- **Dodge**: Chance to completely avoid attacks based on agility
- **Block**: Chance to negate damage when actively defending
- **Damage Reduction**: Armor and constitution reduce incoming damage
- **Resistance**: Elemental resistances protect against specific damage types

**Critical Hits:**
Attacks have a chance to critically strike, dealing significantly increased damage. Critical hit chance increases with attributes and specific gear. Visual feedback alerts players to successful critical strikes.

**Combat Feedback:**
The combat log displays turn-by-turn actions, damage dealt, status effects, and tactical outcomes with color-coded text for clarity.

#### Enemy System

**Procedural Generation:**
Enemies are generated dynamically with level scaling, ensuring appropriate challenge for player progression. Enemy power scales with player level while allowing for easier and harder encounters.

**Enemy Traits:**
Enemies possess behavioral and statistical traits affecting combat style:
- Behavioral traits (aggressive, defensive, cowardly, berserker)
- Defensive traits (tank, evasive, regenerating)
- Offensive traits (glass cannon, life steal, thorns)
- Elemental affinities (fire, ice, lightning, poison)

**Boss Encounters:**
Boss enemies feature enhanced statistics and unique mechanics, providing memorable challenges with increased rewards.

### 3. Inventory System

#### Item Management

Players manage a limited inventory with multiple organizational features:

- **Item Storage**: Finite inventory capacity requiring strategic item management
- **Equipment Slots**: Dedicated slots for weapons, armor, shields, and accessories
- **Consumables**: Potions and scrolls usable both in and out of combat
- **Sorting Options**: Organize inventory by name, type, or rarity for easy access

#### Item Categories

The game features diverse item types for different playstyles:

**Weapons:**
Melee and ranged weapons with varying damage types, attack speeds, and attribute requirements. Weapon types suit different character builds and combat strategies.

**Armor:**
Protective gear ranging from light cloth to heavy plate, with varying defense values and mobility impacts. Armor types balance protection against movement freedom.

**Shields:**
Defensive equipment increasing block chance and damage reduction. Shield sizes offer different balance points between protection and combat flexibility.

**Consumables:**
Single-use items providing healing, mana restoration, temporary buffs, or combat advantages. Consumables offer tactical flexibility during challenging encounters.

**Accessories:**
Rings, amulets, and trinkets providing passive bonuses to attributes, resistances, or special abilities. Accessories allow build customization beyond primary equipment.

#### Rarity System

Items exist across multiple rarity tiers, with rarer items offering superior stats and unique properties:

- **Common Items**: Basic equipment readily available
- **Uncommon Items**: Improved stats and occasional bonuses
- **Rare Items**: Significantly enhanced with multiple bonuses
- **Epic Items**: Powerful equipment with substantial advantages
- **Legendary Items**: Exceptionally rare with game-changing properties

Rarity affects drop rates, gold value, and overall item power. Visual color coding helps identify item quality at a glance.

#### Trait System

Items possess traits providing gameplay bonuses and strategic variety:

**Offensive Traits:**
Increase damage output through flat bonuses, percentage multipliers, elemental damage, or special attack effects (life steal, armor penetration, status application).

**Defensive Traits:**
Enhance survivability through defense increases, damage resistance, elemental resistances, or regeneration effects.

**Utility Traits:**
Provide quality-of-life benefits like increased carrying capacity, improved loot drops, faster movement, or resource cost reduction.

**Enchantments:**
Prefix and suffix modifiers that can combine to create uniquely powerful items. The enchantment system allows for tremendous item variety through component combinations.

#### Procedural Generation System

Items are generated dynamically using a data-driven pattern system:

**Name Generation:**
Item names are constructed from composable patterns combining base names, material types, quality modifiers, and magical properties. This creates virtually unlimited item variety while maintaining naming consistency.

**Stat Generation:**
Item statistics scale based on rarity tier, item level, and applied traits. The system ensures items remain balanced while providing meaningful progression.

**Trait Assignment:**
Traits are assigned based on item type, rarity, and available trait pools. Trait combinations create build-defining equipment without manual item design.

**Data-Driven Architecture:**
All item generation rules, trait definitions, and naming patterns live in external data files following established standards (v4.0 JSON specification). This allows content expansion without code changes.

### 4. Progression System

#### Experience & Leveling

Character progression is driven by an experience point (XP) system with an exponential leveling curve:

**XP Sources:**
- Combat victories (scaled to enemy difficulty)
- Quest completion (main and side quests)
- Exploration milestones (discovering locations, finding secrets)
- Achievement unlocks

**Level-Up Rewards:**
Gaining levels increases core stats (HP, MP), provides attribute points for character customization, and unlocks new abilities or skills. The level cap ensures a defined progression arc while providing substantial power growth.

#### Attribute Allocation

Each level-up grants attribute points for flexible character building:

**Build Variety:**
- **Specialization**: Focus points into primary attributes for class mastery
- **Hybrid Builds**: Distribute across multiple attributes for versatile characters
- **Balanced Approach**: Spread points evenly for generalist characters

**Customization Impact:**
Attribute choices directly impact combat effectiveness, survivability, magic power, and utility. Players can respec their builds or commit to focused archetypes based on preferred playstyle.

#### Skills System (Practice-Based Progression)

**Design Philosophy:**
Skills represent learned proficiencies that improve through use—"learning by doing." The skill system provides passive bonuses that automatically apply during relevant actions, creating organic character development distinct from level-based progression.

**Core Concept: "Use It to Improve It"**
- Swing swords → improve One-Handed skill
- Cast spells → improve Destruction/Restoration skills
- Sneak around → improve Stealth skill
- Craft items → improve Blacksmithing/Alchemy skills

**Skill Categories:**
- **Attribute Skills**: STR, DEX, CON, INT, WIS, CHA (improve attributes through use)
- **Combat Skills**: One-Handed, Two-Handed, Archery, Block, Heavy Armor, Light Armor
- **Magic Skills**: Destruction, Restoration, Alteration, Conjuration, Illusion, Mysticism
- **Profession Skills**: Blacksmithing, Alchemy, Enchanting
- **Survival Skills**: Lockpicking, Sneaking, Pickpocketing, Speech

**Skill Mechanics:**
- **Ranking System**: Skills rank from 0 (untrained) to 100 (master)
- **Use-Based XP**: Gain skill XP by using the skill (combat, casting, crafting)
- **Scaling Costs**: Each rank-up costs more XP (prevents instant mastery, rewards specialization)
- **Per-Rank Bonuses**: Each skill has specific modifiers (+0.5% damage, +0.3% block chance, etc.)
- **Passive Application**: Bonuses automatically apply, no activation required

**Build Depth:**
Skills create organic specialization—characters naturally improve at what they do most. Two Warriors who favor different weapons will develop distinct skill profiles, encouraging experimentation and multiple playthroughs.

**Distinct from Abilities & Spells:**
- **Skills** = How good you are at something (passive proficiency, improves with use)
- **Abilities** = Class-granted special powers (active, limited use)
- **Spells** = Learnable magic (active, must be acquired, skill-dependent)

#### Abilities System (Class-Specific Powers)

**Design Philosophy:**
Abilities are class and species-specific active powers defining character identity. A Warrior's Charge, a Rogue's Backstab, a Mage's Fireball—these are signature moves that feel impactful and require conscious activation.

**Core Concept: "Special Powers"**
Abilities are granted by class choice and unlocked through leveling. They're not learned like spells—they're inherent to your class archetype.

**Ability Categories:**
- **Offensive Abilities**: Direct damage attacks (Backstab, Execute, Smite, Fireball)
- **Defensive Abilities**: Active defense maneuvers (Shield Wall, Evasion, Parry)
- **Support Abilities**: Buffs, healing, and utility powers (Battle Cry, Heal, Blessing)
- **Passive Abilities**: Always-active class bonuses (auras, triggered effects)
- **Ultimate Abilities**: Powerful special moves with long cooldowns (Last Stand, Meteor, Assassination)

**Ability Mechanics:**
- **Mana Costs**: Prevent spamming powerful abilities (10-100 mana)
- **Cooldown Timers**: Add tactical decision-making (1-20 turns)
- **Equipment Requirements**: Some abilities require specific gear (shield, staff)
- **Level Requirements**: Gate powerful abilities behind progression

**Class Integration:**
Each class starts with 2-3 signature abilities matching their archetype:
- **Warrior**: Charge, Shield Bash, Whirlwind
- **Rogue**: Backstab, Evasion, Poison Strike
- **Mage**: Fireball, Mana Shield, Frost Nova
- **Cleric**: Smite, Heal, Divine Shield
- **Ranger**: Power Shot, Trap, Hunter's Mark
- **Paladin**: Holy Strike, Protective Aura, Lay on Hands

Additional abilities unlock through leveling (levels 5, 10, 15, 20), creating a growing tactical toolkit.

**Distinct from Skills & Spells:**
- **Skills** = Passive proficiency (always active, improves with use)
- **Abilities** = Class powers (active, always available, class-locked)
- **Spells** = Learnable magic (active, must be acquired, universal access)

#### Magic & Spell System (Learnable Magic)

**Design Philosophy:**
Spells are universal magical knowledge that any character can learn (with sufficient skill) through spellbooks, scrolls, teachers, and quest rewards. Unlike class-specific abilities, spells are accessible to all who invest in magic skills.

**Core Concept: "Knowledge Acquisition"**
Spells must be found, purchased, or taught—they're not automatic. A Warrior can learn Fireball if they develop Destruction skill, though they won't be as effective as a dedicated Mage.

**Spell Schools (Domains):**
- **Destruction**: Offensive magic (fire, ice, lightning damage)
- **Restoration**: Healing and curing magic (heal, regeneration, cure poison)
- **Alteration**: Buffs and utility (shields, stat boosts, feather fall)
- **Conjuration**: Summoning and binding (summon creatures, bound weapons)
- **Illusion**: Mind magic (charm, fear, invisibility)
- **Mysticism**: Detection and teleportation (detect magic, teleport, scrying)

**Spell Mechanics:**
- **Acquisition**: Find spellbooks, buy from merchants, learn from trainers, earn through quests
- **Skill Requirements**: Each spell requires minimum magic skill rank (0-100)
- **Spell Levels**: Novice, Apprentice, Adept, Expert, Master (gated by skill)
- **Mana Costs**: 5-150 mana based on spell power (reduced by skill)
- **Success/Failure**: Casting success based on skill vs spell difficulty (can fizzle or backfire)
- **Skill Scaling**: Higher skill = more damage/healing, lower cost, better success rate

**Spell Learning:**
- **Spellbooks**: Consumable items that teach spells permanently
- **Scrolls**: Single-use spell casting (no skill check required)
- **Trainers**: NPCs teach spells for gold (must meet skill requirement)
- **Quest Rewards**: Unique spells from story/side quests

**Build Variety:**
Spells enable hybrid builds—Warriors casting buffs, Rogues using invisibility, Clerics summoning allies. Spell collection creates exploration incentives and replayability (different spells each playthrough).

**Distinct from Skills & Abilities:**
- **Skills** = Passive proficiency (determines spell effectiveness)
- **Abilities** = Class powers (always available to class members)
- **Spells** = Learnable magic (must be acquired, universal access, skill-dependent)
