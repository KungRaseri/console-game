- ⚠️ Reactive abilities not triggered on combat events
- ⚠️ Combat menu doesn't show spell/ability options
- ⚠️ Enemy abilities not implemented

**Estimated Time to Complete**:
- Ability learning/execution: 3-4 hours
- Passive/reactive integration: 2-3 hours
- Combat menu integration: 2-3 hours
- **Total**: ~8-10 hours of focused development

**All core systems are operational and well-tested. The remaining work is primarily wiring up abilities into the existing command/handler pattern and integrating them into the combat flow.**
